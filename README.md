Audio visualizer, vibe coded using Bolt.

ðŸŽ§ Upload your own tracks or pick from a few Suno demos, then choose from 10+ immersive visualizations that react in real time.

ðŸŽ¤ Got something to say? Grab the mic and watch the visuals respond to your voice. Beatbox, hum, or just vibe out.

ðŸŽ¨ Tweak sensitivity, motion, and colors to match your mood.
